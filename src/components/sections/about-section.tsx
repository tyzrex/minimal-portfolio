          I&apos;m a 3rd year Computer Science student from Tribhuvan
          University, unravelling the art of frontend wizardry. Imagine crafting
          virtual experiences that sparkle and danceâ€”yep, that&apos;s my jam!
          <br />
          <br />
          I&apos;m a self-taught developer who&apos;s passionate about building
          user-friendly, accessible websites and applications. I&apos;m always
          eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I&apos;m currently
          diving deep into the world of React and Next.js.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring the great
          outdoors, riding my bike, hopping cafes, experimenting with new
          recipes, or
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sulavbaral/"> capturing moments</a>
          . I&apos;m also a coffee aficionado, so you&apos;ll often find me
          sipping on a cup of freshly brewed coffee while working on my
          projects.
