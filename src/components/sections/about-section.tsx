          I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student from Tribhuvan University,
          unravelling the art of frontend wizardry. Imagine crafting virtual
          experiences that sparkle and danceâ€”yep, that's my jam!
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm a self-taught developer who's passionate about building
          user-friendly, accessible websites and applications. I'm always eager
          to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I'm currently diving
          deep into the world of React and Next.js.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
          riding my bike, hopping cafes, experimenting with new recipes, or
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sulavbaral/"> capturing moments</a>
          . I'm also a coffee aficionado, so you'll often find me sipping on a
          cup of freshly brewed coffee while working on my projects.
